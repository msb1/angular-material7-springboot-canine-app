          <h3>This website is dedicated to Man's Best Friend - The Doggie. It is not our objective to favor one breed over another as
this is completely a matter of personal preference.  Like the AKC and other Dog-Friendly Organizations, we encourage dogs as family companions;
advance canine health and well-being; advocate for dog owner rights; and educate the public about responsible dog ownership.
We are passionate about everything related to dogs, and we celebrate the joy they bring to our lives every single day.
Being a dog lover is not a pastime; it’s a way of life – and we make every moment count. We cherish each day we spend with our beloved friends...</h3>
